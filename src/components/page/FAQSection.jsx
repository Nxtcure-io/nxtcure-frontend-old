           	1. What if my eligibility or chance of a match is high for multiple trials? Will I need to undergo a full assessment for each one?

	  You may choose to reach out to multiple clinical trials. Depending on your selections, you may need to submit a full assessment for each one separately. If you are eligible for several trials, NxtCure will provide you with an Eligibility Score for each one to help you prioritize based on fit, travel distance, and likelihood of candidacy. You can then choose which trial(s) to explore further. Weâ€™ll provide direct links to trial coordinators so you can contact them to start the screening process.
