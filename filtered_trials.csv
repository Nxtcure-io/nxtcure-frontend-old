Current face-to-face prevention approaches are of limited effectiveness, rely on extensive resources, and are at odds with adolescents' digital preferences. We will evaluate two unconventional but promising interventions delivered to 13- to 17-year-olds: transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation to target emotion dysregulation, and a peer-support smartphone app to combat social isolation.

Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors.

In healthy humans during muscle contraction, there is a blunting of skeletal muscle vascular responsiveness to increases in MSNA. However, the exact mechanisms involved are unknown although, best evidence suggests that the mechanism is endothelium derived, but nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) independent. Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) is a NO and PG independent vasodilator in both cerebral and skeletal muscle circulations, however, it is unknown if EDHF contributes to vascular responsiveness during elevated MSNA. The application of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is a safe and non-invasive manipulation that can be used to increase MSNA causing vasoconstriction in humans.

The investigators propose a straightforward grading scale based on visual and tactile information readily available during RFA procedures as part of routine practice (per radiofrequency electrode: 0 = no twitches palpated or observed; 1 = twitches palpated but not observed; 2 = twitches palpated and observed at 1-2 levels; 3= twitches palpated and observed at \>2 levels). If a higher weighted score (total score divided by number of radiofrequency lesion sites) correlates with a greater likelihood of treatment success, or magnitude or duration of analgesia following cervical RFA, cervical paraspinal muscle twitching may serve as a readily obtainable prognostic factor (marker) for effectiveness.",60,"* Age 18 years or older * Cervical facet arthropathy based on history and physical exam (e.g. axial cervical neck pain, paraspinal tenderness, no pain referral below the ipsilateral shoulder) * Radiologic evidence of cervical pathology consistent with symptoms if MRI is available * Pain duration of greater than 3 months * Obtained 50% or greater pain relief from at least 1 diagnostic cervical medial branch block of the identical medial branch nerves targeted for RFA","* Untreated coagulopathy * Signs or symptoms of cervical myelopathy * Signs or symptoms of cervical radiculitis/radiculopathy * Allergic reactions to local anesthetics * Serious psychiatric disorder (e.g. uncontrolled or refractory depression) that might preclude optimal outcome * Poorly controlled medical condition (e.g. pacemaker that cannot be switched off, unstable angina) * Pregnancy",False,ALL,18 Years,,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States,"Eric Wang, MD",CONTACT,410-955-7246,ewang29@jhmi.edu,Johns Hopkins University,

Participants will undergo pre-operative and six-week post-operative swallowing assessment using videofluoroscopy (VFSS). Acoustic voice samples and Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) for swallowing and voice will also be collected. Beginning one-week before surgery participants will begin a behavioral health program that will be continued for six-weeks after surgery. The primary goal of this study will be to determine whether a preventative behavioral health program improves instrumental measures of swallowing and voice six-weeks after ACDF surgery. .,50,,,False,ALL,21 Years,99 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States,"Sonja Molfenter, PhD",CONTACT,212-992-7694,Smm16@nyu.edu,NYU Langone Health,
